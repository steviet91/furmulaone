# Intro
So I thinking on how to provide a little learning for myself over the next couple of months and landed on trying to make a very basic racing game in C++ (update: I stumbled and fell when it came to visualising so we're back in Python!). I then thought how could this be more useful and figured it would be great tool for others to develop their coding ability or knowledge on self-driving cars. And then I thought (I've had lots of time for thinking) it would be great to add some competition to this all. The rules are still been figured out but here is where I currently am:

- Winner is the user who can drive 5 laps of the circuit in the shortest period of time with any controller, human or non-human.
- The user MUST NOT use any of the buttons used within the provided game controls.
- (some sort of sub prize will be given for the fastest single lap)
- One user can submit as many entrants as they wish

The final event will take place close to the end of the 2 month period (date TBC) at an unspecified track (i.e. not the track(s) that will be provided for testing). I think I'm going to place the source for the car and track in a separate repo and only put the binaries in here to make it more challenging for you!

# Why do this?
Well I thought this would be a fun way for a range of people to upskill in various areas. You could:
- Learn some basic Python and write a game controller or new key board interface, adding logic to the current wasd implementation to give variable torque/braking/steering demands
- Learn about sockets and write a control interface in a different language that sends the commands to the car
- Learn some dumb self-driving car control with the "LIDAR" (if you can call it that) simulation.

# Why am I doing this?
I just wanted a way that I could try and learn about C++ (my target is to write the track and car models in C++; update, i failed but I want to write my controller entry in c++!) that would keep me interested and learn about vehicle models a little more...thats pretty much it...

# What will you win?
I don't know, hopefully a giant shiny trophy...

# How can I participate?
:S
