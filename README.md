# Intro
So I thinking on how to provide a little learning for myself over the next couple of months and landed on trying to make a very basic racing game in C++. I then thought how could this be more useful and figured it would be great to challenge others to hopefully what will be a brutally competetive game. The rules are still been figured out but here is where I currently am:

- Winner is the user who can drive 5 laps of the circuit in the shortest period of time.
- The user MUST NOT use any of the buttons used within the provided game controls.
- (some sort of sub prize will be given for the fastest single lap)
- One user can submit as many entrants as they wish

The final event will take place close to the end of the 2 month period (date TBC) at an unspecified track (i.e. not the track(s) that will be provided for testing).

# Why do this?
Well I thought this would be a fun way for a range of people to upskill in various areas. You could:
- Learn some basic Python and write a game controller or new key board interface
- Learn about sockets and write a control interface in a different language that sends the commands to the car
- Learn some dumb self-driving car control with the "LIDAR" (if you can call it that) simulation.

# Why am I doing this?
I just wanted a way that I could try and learn about C++ (may target is to write the track and car models in C++) that would keep me interested and learn about vehicle models...thats pretty much it...

# What will you win?
I don't know, hopefully a giant shiny trophy...

# How can I participate?
:S
